## **Key Insights**

### **1. Seasonal Peaks in Loan Applications & Fulfillment**
- Loan applications peak in **July and December**, with the lowest volume in **February**.  
- **December sees the highest total loan amount funded and received back.**  
- **Possible Explanation:** Decemberâ€™s spike could be linked to higher interest rates, but a similar increase in interest rates during other months did not significantly impact loan repayment.  
- **Actionable Insight:**  
  - Since December consistently sees high loan volumes and repayments, the bank could introduce **targeted promotions** or **optimize processing capacity** to handle the seasonal surge efficiently.  

### **2. Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio Stability**
- The **average DTI ratio remains steady between 12.9% and 13.7%**, indicating overall financial stability among borrowers.  
- **Actionable Insight:**  
  - Since DTI is stable, underwriting strategies may not need frequent adjustment based on this metric alone. Instead, the focus should be on **other risk indicators like default rates by income brackets**.  

### **3. Income Bracket & Loan Behavior Patterns**
- **Lower-income customers** submit more loan applications, but their individual loan amounts are smaller.  
- **Higher-income customers** tend to apply for larger loans but also have a **higher bad loan rate** (default risk).  
- **Actionable Insight:**  
  - **Risk-Based Pricing:** Given the higher default risk among high-income borrowers, the bank could explore adjusting interest rates based on additional risk factors beyond income.  
  - **Targeted Financial Products:** Consider offering **smaller, more accessible loans** for lower-income customers, as they have higher application volumes but lower individual risk.  

## **Next Steps for Analysis**
1. **Interest Rate Sensitivity:**  
   - Since loan repayment spikes in December but not in other high-interest months, is there a behavioral factor (e.g., bonuses, year-end debt clearing) at play? 
2. **Investigate High-Income Defaults:**  
   - What factors contribute to their higher bad loan rate? Is it over-leverage, investment-related borrowing, or other behavioral trends?  
3. **Explore the July Loan Surge:**  
   - What drives the July peak? Are there external factors like tax refunds, seasonal expenses, or marketing campaigns?
