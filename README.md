The Bank Loan Report project aims to monitor and evaluate lending activities and performance. <br>
It will provide key loan metrics and insights into trends over time, helping to track portfolio health and inform data-driven lending strategies.


***Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:***

1. **Total Loan Applications**: Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2. **Total Funded Amount**: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3. **Total Amount Received**: Track the total amount received from borrowers for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

4. **Average Interest Rate**: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluate the average DTI for our borrowers to help us gauge their financial health. Compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
